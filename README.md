# RandPyPwMan

## What is RandPyPwMan - WIP [Work in progress]
It's a simple and easy to use password generator and password manager that's open-source and made in Python 3.

## How to use it?
Make sure you have Python 3 or higher installed. Either clone the repository or copy the code to a notepad and save as {filename}.py. Then run the program.

## Known problems
- Very ugly
    - Planning to fix UI/UX soon, see comments in main.py for upcoming features
- Need to use functions to add new node and sites
    - ACTIVE FEATURE FOR TREEVIEW, ONCE CONNECTION TO DB IS MADE CAN FINISH THIS
- Encryption (hashing)
    - Looking into the passlib framework/library for this (SHA256)
- Landing/login page
    - Hash/salt a masterkey
- Database functionality
    - Establishing a connection
- README.md sucks
    - Will fix this/make it more accurate as this project matures and really comes to life
