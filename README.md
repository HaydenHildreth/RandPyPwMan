## What is RandPyPwMan - WIP [Work in progress]
It's a simple and easy to use password generator and password manager that's open-source and made in Python 3.

Make sure you have Python 3 or higher installed. Either clone the repository or copy the code to a notepad and save as {filename}.py. Then run the program.
