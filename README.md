# RandPyPwMan

## What is RandPyPwMan - WIP [Work in progress]
It's a simple and easy to use password generator and password manager that's open-source and made in Python 3 using Tkinter. Do not get too attached to the name as it will likely be changing before the final release. Program screenshots are available in main branch README.

## How to use it?
Make sure you have Python 3 or higher installed. Either clone the repository and un-compress the file the execute, or copy the code to a notepad and save as {filename}.py. Then run the install.py, then you can happily use the splashscreen.py. The install.py installer will be implemented into the main.py for final release. I also plan to streamline the execution of program to better hide "splashscreen.py".

## Known problems
- Very ugly
    - Planning to fix UI/UX soon

## Major Patch Notes
- ### See commit logs for more detailed information.
