# RandPyPwMan

## What is RandPyPwMan - Work in progress [WIP]
It's a simple and easy to use password generator and password manager that's open-source and made in Python 3 using Tkinter. Do not get too attached to the name as it will likely be changing before the final release.

## How to use it?
Make sure you have Python 3 or higher installed. Either clone the repository and un-compress the file the execute, or copy the code to a notepad and save as {filename}.py. Then run the install.py, then you can happily use the splashcreen.py. The install.py installer will be implemented into the main.py for final release. The process of starting the application will also be streamlined.

## Known problems
- Very ugly
    - Planning to fix UI/UX soon
- Encryption 
    - Using Cryptography package
        - Already partially implemented within encryption2 branch
- Landing/login page (hashing)
    - Hash/salt a masterkey (already done in dev/encryption branch)

## News
In version 0.4.5 I've added a login screen/splash screen. Alongside a hashed master password. See the dev branch for more details.
